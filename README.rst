# sphinxcontrib-excel-reader

An sphinx extension to render an excel table as an excel-alike table in Sphinx documentation.

This contrib is inspired by sphinxcontrib-excel, which uses pyexcel and handsontable to do the
work, but the sphinxcontrib-excel-reader will instead use openpyxl and handsontable, mainly to
support merged cell.
